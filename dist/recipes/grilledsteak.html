    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Marinated flank steak makes dinner an ace in the hole. Mix a quick marinade with soy sauce, honey, garlic, and
        pepper for a grilled flank steak recipe you’ll go to again and again.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar </li>
        <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For The Steak</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2-pound) flank steak</li>
        <li>Coarse salt, to taste (optional) </li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste (optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Marinate the steak:</h4>
            <p>
                Combine the marinade ingredients in a large non-reactive bowl.

                Place the steak in the bowl and turn it, so it is completely coated with the marinade. (You can also
                place the steak and marinade in a plastic freezer bag and place it in a bowl.)

                Chill and marinate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Prepare your grill: </h4>
            <p>
                Prepare the grill for high, direct heat with one part of the grill for lower, indirect heat. The grill
                is hot enough when you hold your hand about an inch over the hot side, and you can only hold it there
                for about a second.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Grill the steak:</h4>
            <p>
                Remove the steak from the marinade and gently shake off the excess marinade from the steak (But make
                sure there is still a coating of it, you'll want the oil on it to help keep the steak from sticking to
                the grill.).

                If you want, sprinkle generously on all sides with coarse salt and freshly ground pepper. The salt and
                pepper will help form a savory crust on the steak.

                Place steak on the hot side of the grill. Grill for a minute or two on each side to get a good sear.
                Then, move the steak to the cooler side of the grill, cover and cook a few minutes more until done to
                your liking.
            </p>
            <p>
                How do you know when the steak is done? One way to tell is to poke it with your fingertips. While the
                steak is still raw, test it with your fingers; it will be quite squishy. That's what a very rare steak
                feels like. Touch the tip of your nose and that's what a very well done steak feels like. Here's a
                visual guide, the finger test to check the doneness of steak.

                Otherwise, use a good meat thermometer (I recommend a Thermapen.) Pull the steak off the grill at 120
                to 125°F for rare, 130-140°F for medium rare, and 145°F for medium.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Rest the steak: </h4>
            <p>
                When the steak has cooked to your liking, remove from the grill and place on a cutting board. Cover with
                aluminum foil to hold in the heat while the steak rests for 10 to 15 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Slice across the grain: </h4>
            <p>
                Notice the direction of the muscle fibers of the steak; this is called the grain of the meat. Flank
                steak is a very lean cut that will be tough and chewy unless you cut it in a way that breaks up the
                muscle fibers.

                So, cut the steak across the grain of the meat, at a steep diagonal, so that the slices are wide. I
                find it easiest to use a long serrated bread knife for this, but any long sharp knife will do.

        <li>
            <h4>Preheat the oven to 375°F. </h4>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Assemble the lasagna: </h4>
            <p>
                In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the
                dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, the edges may overlap,
                depending on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.

                Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagna sauce. Add half of the
                ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple of inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan
                cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.

                Apply the second layer of noodles and top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the
                remaining mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.

                Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and
                sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Bake: </h4>
            <p>
                Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce).
                Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or
                edges.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Cool and serve: </h4>
            <p>
                Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. You can
                reheat it in a conventional oven or microwave. Leave the aluminum tent on for storage. (Try to keep the
                aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)
